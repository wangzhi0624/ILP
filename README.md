The repository is for the Individual Learning Project at Lincoln University. 
## Project Introduction
The project aims to develop a real-time web application tailored to the needs of an early childcare centre in Auckland. This application will streamline various management tasks, including monitoring teacher-child ratios, managing attendance, and optimizing resource allocation. By automating these processes, the application will enhance efficiency, compliance with regulations, and overall operational effectiveness of the childcare centre.
### Project Objectives
#### 1. Develop a user-friendly web application that facilitates real-time monitoring of teacher-child ratios.
#### 2. Implement features for managing attendance, including parent sign-in/sign-out functionality.
#### 3. Create a dynamic resource allocation system to optimize staffing levels based on attendance data.
#### 4. Ensure compliance with Ministry of Education regulations regarding teacher-child ratios.
#### 5. Improve communication and coordination among staff members through the application.
