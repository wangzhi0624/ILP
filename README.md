## Project Introduction
The project aims to develop a real-time web application tailored to the needs of an early childcare centre in Auckland. This application will streamline various management tasks, including monitoring teacher-child ratios, managing attendance, and optimizing resource allocation. By automating these processes, the application will enhance efficiency, compliance with regulations, and overall operational effectiveness of the childcare centre.
